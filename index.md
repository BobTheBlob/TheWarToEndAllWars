### What is the war to end all wars?
It is a strategy game which starts in 1914 you chose any country and are thrust into the war, your objective for the beggining is survive or win the war.
After the war you need to prevent WW2, unless you start it . EG. You as Brittian,  declare war on Germany and they are backed by France and Russia.
After either winning or preventing WW2 the world has an event thrusting all major powers into an arms race. The whole point of the game is to survive for as long 
as you can! I intend on adding Machine learning so that the ai eventually learns your habbits and uses them to their advantage.
